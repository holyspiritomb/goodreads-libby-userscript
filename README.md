# Goodreads Libby Userscript

Userscript that will search for the book you are looking at on Goodreads and Amazon across all your Libby libraries with cards. Forked from [Dylancyclone](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/goodreads-libby-userscript).

## Installation

1. Make sure you have a browser extension that can run userscripts:

    * [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
    * [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)
    * [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

2. Install:

    * Install the script directly from GitHub through one of these links: [Install](https://github.com/holyspiritomb/libby-userscript/raw/main/libby-availability.user.js) | [Install via Adguard for Android](https://github.com/holyspiritomb/libby-userscript/raw/main/libby-availability-adguard.user.js)


## Usage

Go to the [Libby webapp's main menu](https://libbyapp.com/interview/menu) and click the "Save Libraries" button.

Then, search for a book on Goodreads or Amazon. When you've found a book, the userscript will search across all your libby libraries and show the results.

You can then click the number of results to be taken to the search page for that library.

## Updating

Userscripts are set up to automatically update. You can check for updates from within the Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey menu, or click on the install link again to get the update.

## Issues

Please report any issues within this repository's [issue section](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/goodreads-libby-userscript/issues). I'm not a very active userscript developer, so Greasyfork messages are a little more difficult to work with. Thanks!
